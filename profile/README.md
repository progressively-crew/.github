## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the page of the Progressively Crew.

### 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

[Progressively](https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively) is a naive feature flag solution focusing on providing lightweight client side SDKs and an accessible dashboard. It also does not track anything about the users, only flag requested and their variations.

### 🌈 Contributions

We are looking for people wanting to try the tool as it is and to provide feedback on what they expect it to be or to do.

Also, it would be very interesting to create new SDKs so that people from other community can use this tool. Feel free to contact us if you're interested in building something like that.
